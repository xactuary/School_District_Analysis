# SCHOOL DISTRICT ANALYTICS PROJECT
## Summary
The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate the effect that removing a case of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School has on the overall School District Analysis Results. The technical challenge is to use Python Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook to adjust the data to exclude the Thomas High School scores and recalculate the overall school district statistics.    
### Background
The original School District Analysis, used two datasets to produce a grid of statistics by which Maria, the chief data scientist for the School District, could present to her superiors to see what was happening with math and reading scores by school and type in the district.  Data was also provided about the budget of the schools to see if there is any correlation between the amount of funds spent at a school and the level of test scores.
